function sayHi() {

    console.log(age);
    // var name = 'Lydia';

undefined, reffence err because the console.log is call before the age is assigned
name type is var so it's still get value undefined.

/* Question 2:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}

// The answer is 3 3 3, 0 1 2: Why?
// Explaination: Event Loop is a way browser work, when see setTimeOut funcion, it's not run, but push this into a callback queue,
// When the stack is blank, it get first element from queue (FIFO), push to stack and handler (it's time the code run).
// the tricky here is different betwwen let and var type, if 2 function is use var: value is: 3,3,3,3,3,3
// if both is let: => 0 1 2 0 1 2 => as all of us expect
// why?
// so the first loop: the var i is push to queue 3 time with value of i is 3 because it's global var
// queue => [log var i, log var i, log var i] with i = 3.
// second loop => [log var i (3), log var i (3), log var i (3), log let i (0), log let i (1), log let i (2)]
///  and the 3 3 3 0 1 2 is push to stack => execute => output we see

Explain: Arrow function not bind there own this, so it's can't know what this.radius is

/* Question 4
console.log(+true) => 1 
console.log(!'Lydia') => false
String has character return true, so !true is false
Unary plus: trying to convert anything into number
+true  // 1
+false // 0
+null  // 0
+function(val){ return val } // NaN
+1n    // throws TypeError: Cannot convert BigInt value to number

console.log(greetign); => {}
// Explain: it still assign value
Why: In a basic coding example youâ€™ll not notice a difference in a development console. Everything still acts as you would expect. Prefer using the let keyword and local scope and ECMAScript 6 strict mode.

/* Question 10:
function bark() {

//   Explain: it's still work no matter what
JavaScript functions are a special type of objects, called function objects.
A function object includes a string which holds the actual code -- the function body -- of the function.
The code is literally just a string.
console.log(bark instanceof Object);    // => true
