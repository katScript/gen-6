Question: Imagine you have a 200 GB file on disk, with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file with only 2 GB RAM machine.


Solution:

We have
Size of file: 200 GB
Size of RAM: 20 GB

In a moment, we can sort 1/10 of file. Therefore, ...

  Step 1: Divide target file into 10 pieces (temporary files)
    We have 10 temporary files that has size 20 GB (it's equal to size of RAM)

  Step 2: We can sort 10 pieces, one by one.

  Final: We have 10 sorted pieces,
    and then merge them into 1 file
    this is a result we need


Running time (Big O notation): O((n/10)*(log[n]))
Extra space: O(n)
