Question: Imagine you have a 200 GB file on disk, with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file with only 2 GB RAM machine.


Solution:

We have
Size of file: 200 GB
Size of RAM: 20 GB

In a moment, we can sort 1/10 of file. Therefore, ...

  Step 1: Divide target file into 10 pieces (temporary files)
    We have 10 temporary files that has size 20 GB (it's equal to size of RAM)

  Step 2: We can sort 10 pieces, one by one.

  Step 3: We continue to divide 10 pieces into (10*2) pieces, divide each piece into two other pieces

  Iterate until length of one file is one string

  From here, we can merge them with 2 piece in a moment

    How to merge: 
      First: We have two pieces, each piece contains one string
      Next, We can sort two pieces (sort two strings) and merge them
      And we have a new piece that contains sorted strings

  Do 'How to merge' until all small pieces become a file with length equal to original file

  Final: We have 10 sorted pieces,
    and then merge them into 1 file
    this is a result we need


Running time (Big O notation): O(n*(log[n]))
Extra space: O(n)
